# ðŸš€ Deploy Now - Quick Start

## Step 1: Push to GitHub (Do this first!)

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git push
```

âœ… This will trigger automatic deployments on both Render and Vercel!

## Step 2: Wait for Deployments (~3-5 minutes)

### Check Render
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find `live-sensor-backend` service
3. Watch the "Events" tab - wait until you see "Deploy live"
4. Copy your backend URL (e.g., `https://live-sensor-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`)

### Check Vercel
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your project
3. Watch for deployment completion
4. Copy your frontend URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

---

## Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

### On Render (Backend)
1. Go to your service â†’ **Environment** tab
2. You'll see `FRONTEND_URL` listed (from render.yaml)
3. Click on it and set the value to your Vercel URL
4. Example: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
5. Save (will trigger redeploy - wait ~2 minutes)

### On Vercel (Frontend)
1. Go to your project â†’ **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
2. Add new variable:
   - Name: `REACT_APP_API_URL`
   - Value: Your Render backend URL (e.g., `https://live-sensor-backend-xxxx.onrender.com`)
   - Select: âœ“ Production âœ“ Preview âœ“ Development
3. Save
4. Go to **Deployments** â†’ Click â‹¯ on latest â†’ **Redeploy**

## Step 4: Test (After ~2 minutes)

### Test Backend
Open in browser:
```
https://YOUR-BACKEND-URL.onrender.com/
```
Should show: `{"msg": "Backend is up!"}`

### Test Frontend
1. Open your Vercel URL
2. Press F12 (DevTools)
3. Check Console tab - no CORS errors = âœ… Success!
